# Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction-Analysis
## Project Description

The main purpose of this dataset is to predict whether a future customer would be satisfied with their service given the details of the other parameters values.
Also the airlines need to know on which aspect of the services offered by them have to be emphasized more to generate more satisfied customers.


## About Data

This data given by an airline organization. The actual name of the company is not given due to various purposes. The data set downloaded from Kaggle. This data set have a 25976 rows with 25 columns such as Flight Distance, Baggage handling, Checkin service, nflight entertainment, Type of Travel and so on. The data set consist of a column under the name of Satisfaction describing the overall passenger satisfaction level which are neutral or dissatisfied and satisfied. 

## Data Cleaning and Visualisation

In this project, the Arrival Delay in Minutes column has 310 missing values in it. Therefore, I cleaned the data for fill column nan value at “Arrival Delay in Minutes” using the mean. The reason why i used mean because my data has normal distribution and the data did not have outliers. I removed Unnamed column from data. ID column was integer. I changed the ID column to category using category index function. Basically, data cleaning consists of processes like removing duplicate values, filling missing values and replacing missing values. We will learn more understanding and detailed about data with data visualization.

## In this project, I utilize different Python packages, including:

-  Pandas
-  Numpy
-  Matplotlib
-  Seaborn
-  itertools

# The Dashboard Features

- A correlation can be positive(1) or negative(0). When a correlation is positive there is an increase of value, and is negative value of one variables increases, the other decreases. In this data set, There is no perfect correlation between of them have a correlation coefficient exactly equal to 1. We do not have reliable result (except Departure delay in minutes and Arrival delay in minutes 96%). if Arrival Delay and Departure Delay  goes up impact is negative for satistafction, so it's not a beneficial correlation.
- Customer satisfaction doesn't depend on Gender.
- Business class and travel passangers are more satisfied, and majority of satisfied people prepare to choose business class.
- They need to Concentrate on Cleanliness, so Cleanliness has greatly affects on satisfaction.
- Customers provided with services with 4-5 grades are more satisfied.
- They need to focus and Concentrate on personal travel and Eco class because they are the most dissatisfied passanger. Most of our customers used for business reason rather than personal reasons.
- Passangers ages are between the ages of 30 and 55 (average of age is a little over 40).
- In age group 10-30, the number of neutral/dissatisfied passengers is higher compared to satisfied passengers unlike in age group 40-50, the number of neutral/dissatisfied passengers.





## Technologies
To complete this project, I used Python.
